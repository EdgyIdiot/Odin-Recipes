    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Flat Iron Steak</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 Mince Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
<h4>Steps</h4>
        <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
